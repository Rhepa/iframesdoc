			<h2>Inspiration/Process</h2>
			<p>
				I had few ideas in mind on what theme I wanted to focus on. I basically layed out the stuff I love the most then started googling and researching interesting websites and videos that I could find. So far, only cats have caught my attention so I chose to focus on cats.

				I chose to focus on cats. I didn't want to make it look plain so I drew simple cat drawings that I used as a decorative feature and background. In terms of color scheme, I aimed for pastel/pale colors. Pastel yellow paired best with the image of the iframes in my opinion. I wanted to add more colors but that would make it overwhelming, so I made some of the fonts have an animation of color changing to make it extra cute.

					In terms of structure, I put the iframes in a certain order so it flows well with the paragraphs. 
					
					<p>
						An issue I faced is that the majority of the websites I wanted to use, couldn't display so I had to find alternatives, or change a bit of the URL (such as Youtube videos). Another issue was when I put the Iframes into the white box.It would not scale properly when I see it on my phone.
